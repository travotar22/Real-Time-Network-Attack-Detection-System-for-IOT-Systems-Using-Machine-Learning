# Real-Time-Network-Attack-Detection-System-for-IOT-Systems-Using-Machine-Learning
This project captures real-time network traffic using Scapy, extracts essential packet features, and preprocesses them for a KNN classifier. The pre-trained model then determines if a packet indicates malicious activity. It aids network administrators in monitoring for suspicious activities in real-time.
